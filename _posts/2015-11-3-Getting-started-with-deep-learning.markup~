**Deep learning** is a very fast growing field of machine learning which utilizes large neural networks (in terms of the number of nodes, number of layers as well as the number of connections between the nodes). Unlike several other machine learning  algorithms one does not need to hand-pick the features for a deep-learning algorithm as it automatically extracts suitable features from the data. I have decided to get my feet wet in this area recently as I found its premise very interesting. 

Since I am just a beginner I will not be able to get into explaining the nitty-gritty of explaining deep learning algorithms (as I will most probably fall short in this endeavour). What I would like to do is share some resources (*free*) which I found on the net that I believe are accessible to beginners and a good starting point for understanding deep learning. 

The resources that I will be following over the course of next two months in no particular order of preference are:
* **Deep learning lectures by Prof. Nando de Frietas, University of Oxford:** Prof. Freitas takes a graduate level course for deep learning at the University of Oxford whose video lectures he has generously made available for the general public. I have gone through the first three lectures as of now and although the sound i s a little bit shaky, the quality of the explanations more than make up for it. 
* **Deep learning tutorial by LISA Lab, University of Montreal :** This tutorial gives hands-on experience with deep learning by using Theano, a Python based library for GPU based computations which speeds up training of deep learning based models greatly. This tutorial provides a brief introduction to the basics of machine learning and then moves on to explaining different deep learning algorithms. 
* **Unsupervised feature learning and deep learning tutorial, Stanford University:**

Besides these, there are several great resources to be found at [deeplearning.net](https://www.deeplearning.net) as well as in this git repository [awesome deep learning]().

Hope you have a great experience learning about deep learning.
