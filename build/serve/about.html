## About

Hello there! I am Shashank Shekhar, an undergraduate (junior) at Indian School of Mines, Dhanbad. I like reading novels, browsing memes and am currently trying (strongly) to get a hang of teaching computers how to learn. I am fascinated by machine learning and its applications and as of now hope to pursue a career in research.
