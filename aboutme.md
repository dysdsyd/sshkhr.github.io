My name is Shashank Shekhar. I did my bachelor's in Electronics and Communication Engineering from Indian Institute Of Technology (ISM) Dhanbad.  

After that I worked at Samsung Research Institute Delhi for a while before joining the Visual Computing Lab at Department Of Computational and Data Science at Indian Institute Of Science Bangalore where I currently work as a research assistant.
