Hello there. My name is Shashank Shekhar and my broad field of interest is artificial intelligence with particular interests in reinforcement learning and computer vision.

I did my bachelor's in Electronics and Communication Engineering from Indian Institute Of Technology (ISM) Dhanbad in 2017. After that I worked at Samsung Research Institute Delhi for a while before joining the Department Of Computational and Data Sciences at Indian Institute Of Science, Bangalore where I currently work as a research assistant.  

My work here is in the area of computer vision. I have worked on fundamental topics like learning better visual representations across time, view and modalities and their applications to person and face identification. I have also worked on different applied problems in vision like object detection, image segmentation and image super-resolution. Apart from it's applications in vision I have also been exploring other topics in machine learning on my own and found reinforcement learning to be extremely interesting. I have since had some some practice implementing both (broad) types of RL algorithms in value iteration and policy gradients for personal projects.

Please feel free to browse through my website for links to my projects, publications and other information about me.
